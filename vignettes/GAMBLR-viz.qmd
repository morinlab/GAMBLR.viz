*If you find MAFtools insufficient for your needs but don't have the time or patience to master the nuances of ComplexHeatmap, GAMBLR.viz might be right for you.*

## What it does

The over-arching goal of GAMBLR.viz is to facilitate exploratory data analysis in
cancer genomics studies by reducing the barrier to generating eye-pleasing
representations of standard data types. This package was inspired
by similar resources such as MAFtools. For our work, we found the available tools
were insufficient for our needs. 
In particular, the visualizations produced by GAMBLR.viz cater to some of the
unique genetic features of B-cell lymphomas. For example, mutation patterns
in non-coding regions due to aberrant somatic hypermutation. We also provide
convenient resources such as colour palettes that allow data and metadata in your
figures to have consistent aesthetics.


## GAMBLR family

GAMBLR.viz is part of a larger family of R tools for the analysis of lymphoma
genomic data (*the GAMBLRverse*, if you will). GAMBLR began as a toolkit for analysts participating
in the **G**enomic **A**nalysis of **M**ature **B**-cell **L**ymphomas project, 
led by the [Morin Lab](https://morinlab.github.io/) at BC Cancer and Simon Fraser
University.

GAMBLR.viz intends to provide straightfoward ways to mine cancer genomic
results while leveraging the conveneince features afforded by other members of the GAMBLR family. 
A user can analyze and explore B-cell lymphoma genomics data
relying entirely on GAMBLR.viz and the rest of the GAMBLR packages. We continue to develop
more visualization tools, as well as improve their functionality.

## Local experience

The functions provided with GAMBLR.viz, including all dependencies, are
immediately available upon package installation and do not require internet
connection or ssh access to GSC resources. It can run anywhere that R is
available without restrictions and limitations.

## Use cases

You can use GAMBLR.viz at any step of your lymphoma data analysis workflow, from
initial data exploration to preparation of manuscript-ready figures.

GAMBLR.viz helps with:

* generate manuscript-ready plots in a simple and reproducible manner.
* one-stop shop to generate high-level or region-specific visualizations for
genomic data analysis.
* implement consistent coloring scheme and pallettes for different types of
annotations.
* overcome learning curve using individual packages commonly implemented in the
data visualization field.
