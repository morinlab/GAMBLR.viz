    "text": "GAMBLR.viz is the top-most member of the GAMBLR family of packages that is designed to be used outside of GSC and for users who are not members of Morin Lab. It mostly serves the purpose of providing functions for high-level visualizations of genomic data, including simple somatic mutations, structural variations, copy number alterations, and combinations of these data.\nThe GAMBLR family includes:\n\nGAMBLR.data - collection of genomic data for analysis of Mature B-cell neoplasms\nGAMBLR.helpers - a set of low-level functions for data operation\nGAMBLR.utils - higher level set of functions to operate on genomic data\nGAMBLR.viz - this package\nGAMBLR.results - used to access the full data in GAMBL project. Only available for members of the Morin Lab and requires access to GSC, but can also be run locally once properly configured and synced.\n\nThis diagram illustrates in a simplified way the dependency relationship of different packages in the GAMBLR.family:\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A(\"GAMBLR.data\") --&gt; B(\"GAMBLR.helpers\")\n  B --&gt; C(\"GAMBLR.utils\")\n  C --&gt; D(\"GAMBLR.viz\")\n  D --&gt; E{\"Morin Lab member?\"}\n  E -- YES --&gt; F(\"GAMBLR.results\")\n  E -- NO --&gt; A\n\n\n\n\n\nAll dependencies should be installed automatically for you, just like with any other R package. If not, please report the issue in the appropriate GitHub repo.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "There are several key concepts underlying the logic behind the GAMBLR.viz package. The main terms are:\n\nthese_samples_metadata: This is a data frame with a set of minimal required columns: patient_id, Tumor_Sample_Barcode, sample_id, seq_type, sex, cohort, and pathology. The columns like sex and cohort can contain NA values but must be present in the metadata. The main purpose of this data frame is to provide a structure for the metadata that is always expected to be available and provides linkage between unique sample identifiers and associated basic metadata values. The columns Tumor_Sample_Barcode and sample_id are expected to share the same values, but are required to be present for direct operation on the outputs of different upstream tools.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
