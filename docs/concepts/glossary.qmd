title: "GAMBLR.viz glossary"

There are several key concepts underlying the logic behind the GAMBLR.viz
package. The main terms are:

* **these_samples_metadata:** This is a data frame with a set of minimal required columns:
`patient_id`, `Tumor_Sample_Barcode`, `sample_id`, `seq_type`, `sex`, `cohort`,
and `pathology`. The columns like sex and cohort can contain NA values but must
be present in the metadata. The main purpose of this data frame is to provide
a structure for the metadata that is always expected to be available and
provides linkage between unique sample identifiers and associated basic metadata
values. The columns `Tumor_Sample_Barcode` and `sample_id` are expected to
share the same values, but are required to be present for direct operation on
the outputs of different upstream tools.
